# Problem

Most organizations feel like getting a temporary outfitter guide permit approved is too difficult. The chances of getting the permit approved is slim, especially considering the amount of work that goes into the process, a lot of which is duplicated with each permit application, each year. Some organizations had multiple staff member that were dedicated to managing these applications and spent months focusing on permit application submission and management. 

Most organizations have clear structures, staff and plans that are consistent year after year. There is a strong desire from guides and organization to eliminate the duplicative efforts and unnecessary process. 

Many organizations also wondered if it would be possible to allow for some sort of prioritization for organizations and guides that have good track records using the National Forests lands and maintaining proper training and certification.

Another common concern heard during research and interviews was the lack of updates and status of their application after it was submitted. Organizations would often hear nothing for months and then hear that either the permit was approved or rejected. Organizations are then in a position to either make plans to use other resources or plan and promote their trips in a short period of time.

## Applicant profiles
Allow guides and organization a way to save profiles. These profiles could have basic info about the organization, its background, how it performs, client overview and review and even ranking and information about past use, including comments and validation from SUAs etc. If their activities are the same or similar each year, it can save time having this info saved in the system. It would also be easier for Special Use Admins, avoiding the task of gathering and reviewing basic info that is the same year after year.

For example, an organization may take the same type of clients on the same trips and prefer the same trailheads each year. They may use the same or some of the same guides. If organizations could submit only new or changed information, the application would be easier to submit and quicker for the SUAs to process. In these cases it it may just be a matter of date availability and verifying some additional requirements.

## Application categories
Create a set of categories with unique steps, process and timeline. Special Use Admins could review the application when initially submitted and apply a category based on the specific details of the request. This assignment would generate an email to the applicant giving them a more detailed and clear outline of the steps and timeline. 

This would allow SUAs to review an application and the details of trips and assign a process that is appropriate for each application and organization. 

Simple requests with clear defined details can be assigned a shorter process, giving applicants a better idea of what to expect regarding, additional requirements and timeline. Applications that are more complicated and might have open questions or vague details could be assigned a category that implies a longer timeframe, additional steps and information from the applicant. This will give applicants clear expectations of the process and help prepare them for next steps, also enabling them to be responsive in a more timely basis.

## Progress Status
Name and assign a progress status to an application as the process moves forward. Automate communication of the application status to the applicant as the SUA moves thought the process. 

Some of these statuses may just be alerts that the SUA has approved some details of the application, like availability of dates or locations. Others could have additional requirements and actions associated with them. For example, one stage could be a conditional approval, “Approved, once all guide information is provided.” This would give organizations more visibility into the process as well as enough confirmation to plan trips and hire guides.


## Increased visibility into progress
Create a process where SUAs communicate more frequently with applicants. Regularly communicating application status will help give the applicants more insight into the process and help them feel confident that the application is moving forward. 

This may also decrease the amount of random phone calls and emails sent to SUAs or departments checking on the status of an application. 

Knowing many organization can not offer or promote trips before knowing their application is approved, giving more visibility into the process could increase the comfort level of the applicant and overall relationship organizations have with the Forest Service.
Assign relationships
Most organizations and SUAs mentioned that they build a relationship over the application process period. If an admin could be assigned to a “registered” or established organization year after year. That relationship could streamline the process each year. 


# Problem

Providing guide information is the most time consuming task for guides and organizations. Listing the guides that will be part of each trip during the permit period and documenting all training and certifications, requires dozens of document for each guide. 

# Solutions
**Option 1:** Develop a spreadsheet template for listing guides and qualifications. One organization had created a spread sheet with a column for each area of information required. If we could also create a way to list and verify proof of certification, using confirmation or certificate numbers, the guide info could be combined into one document for upload.

**Option 2:** Create a database of guide profiles. A guide would be responsible for keeping their profile up to date and accurate, regarding qualifications, contact info and certifications. Then, when an organization is applying for a temp outfitter permit they could simply assign guides from the database to a permit, without needing to gather and attach the info for each permit. The guide profiles could be categorized and ranked, identifying guide training and certification level. This way an SUA could quickly see if all the guides assigned to the trips all meet the requirements, making the process much quicker.

All SUAs, guides and organizations were very positive about this type of system and how helpful they felt it would be.
