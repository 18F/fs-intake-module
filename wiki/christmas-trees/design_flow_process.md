#Design Approval and Review Process
1. After initial content workflow (content is researched, added to story, approved by Amber and Melissa) create one or more design mockups to address the content.  
Note: Design mockups could be done in html/live code on a branch or in any other tool.  
2. Attach one or more screenshots of designs (as needed) to the story and uses @symbol address to notify  for review.
3. If necessary a small adhoc meeting to demo the mockups should be held.
4. Task to approve design mockups is checked as done by approver.
5. If needed, usability testing is done on the selected mockup.
6. Pending usability, developer incorporates finished design into a PR, 
or works with another developer to incorporate the design into a pull request.
7. Once PR is merged and on staging all parties review for consistency. If changes are needed
additional tasks can be added to the story or into another story for future prioritization.
