The map shows no cutting areas, and paved and gravel roads in the Skykomish Ranger District, Washington.  This is Map #5. For current road conditions and information call or stop by the district office. Many miles of road are shown on this large scale map.  There are pockets of no cutting areas throughout.  Generally, there is no cutting along the South Fork Skykomish River/Highway 2, and portions of the North Fork Skykomish River/forest road 63. There is a section of forest road 63 that is closed due to a washout. Because of this, the main access to the cutting areas would be from highway 2 to forest road 65. Permits are non-refundable.
