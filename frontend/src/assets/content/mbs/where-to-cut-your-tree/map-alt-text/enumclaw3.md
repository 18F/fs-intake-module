The map shows cutting areas, forest boundary, a sno-park road, and paved and gravel roads in the Enumclaw area of the Snoqualmie Ranger District, Washington.  This is Map #10. Forest roads 72 and 7220 are roads where a Christmas tree cutter could find Douglas-fir, noble fir, and silver fir. Snow conditions may prohibit access to some areas. Travel 20 miles east to forest road 70, follow forest road 70 to forest road 72 (approximately 6 miles) past the gravel pit. Follow forest road 72 one mile to forest road 7220 or continue on forest road 72. To access the area travel east on highway 410 for 24 miles to forest road 72. Note: Northwest Forest Pass is not valid for parking in sno-park. Due to harvesting over the last 14 years the availability of trees is becoming limited. Note: Sno-park permit required to park on road or parking areas (Greenwater sno-park). For current road conditions and information call or stop by the district office. Cut in designated areas only. Permits are non-refundable. Map was revised 10/2004 M. Cabe.
