* Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect you back. Cell service is spotty or non-existent.
* Check the latest weather conditions and road hazards before you leave on your trip as conditions may have changed since you purchased your permit.
* Don’t rely on GPS because it may not be up-to-date with forest service roads.
* Drive safely and be alert for winter driving conditions. Your vehicle should be equipped with 4-wheel drive, snow tires, chains, and a shovel.
* Forest Service roads that are plowed in the winter may have heavy logging traffic. Stay alert and give log truck and equipment plenty of space.
* Be sure your vehicle has a full tank of gas.
* Bring a spare key and give it to someone else in your party. Don’t get locked out of your car!
* Park in areas so that traffic can get by safely and do not block gates.
* Start your day early. Be sure to find your tree and leave the woods before dark.
