* Be sure someone knows where you are and when to expect you back. Cell service is spotty, or nonexistent, in many National Forests.
* Check the latest weather conditions and road hazards before you leave on your trip as conditions may have changed since you purchased your permit.
* Don’t rely on GPS because it may not be up-to-date with forest service roads. Bring a [forest or district map](/christmas-trees/forests/mthood/#tree-locations) with you.
* Expect winter conditions, including below-freezing temperatures and cold winds. Dress warmly and take extra dry clothes.
* Roads may not be plowed. Carry tire chains, shovel(s) & tow chain. Bring an overnight survival kit in case you become stranded. Also, start your trip with a full tank of gas.
* Bring a spare key and give it to someone else in your party. Don’t get locked out of your car!
* Start your day early. Be sure to find your tree and leave the woods before dark.
* When you park, be sure other vehicles can get by safely. Do not block gates.
