* Do not pick a tree within 100 feet of a trail, 200 feet of campgrounds or recreation sites, or within 300 feet of a stream or lake.
* Be sure another tree has space to grow within 8 feet of the one you plan to cut. Cutting trees from overcrowded areas is beneficial, as the remaining trees will grow faster.
* Tools you might want to consider bringing with you include a hacksaw or axe to cut your tree; gloves to protect your hands; a tarp to sit on and/or to move your tree once its cut; and rope or straps to secure your tree to your vehicle.
* Avoid trees marked with blue paint or designated as a wildlife tree.
* Motorized saws and chainsaws are prohibited.
* Cut your tree a bit longer than you'll need (6-12"), so you'll have room to make a fresh cut on the bottom before putting it in water.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall and ensure all members of your party (and your car) are out of the path of the falling tree.
* Remove any boughs from the stump and scatter around a large area.
* Clean up any debris after youâ€™re finished cutting down your tree.
