Don’t rely on GPS because it may not be up-to-date with forest service roads. Bring a [forest or district map](/christmas-trees/forests/arp/#tree-locations) with you.

Expect winter conditions, including below-freezing temperatures and cold winds. Dress warmly and take extra dry clothes.


* Roads may not be plowed. Carry tire chains, shovel(s) and a tow chain. Bring an overnight survival kit in case you become stranded.
* Be sure your vehicle has a full tank of gas.
* Bring a spare key and give it to someone else in your party. Don’t get locked out of your car!
* Park in areas so that traffic can get by safely, and do not block gates.
* Start your day early. Be sure to find your tree and leave the woods before dark.
* We don't recommend bringing your pets but, if you do, they must be on a leash.
