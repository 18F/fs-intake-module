#### Christmas tree cutting

* Only cut trees within the national forest boundary.
* Tree-topping is prohibited. Cut down the whole tree. 
* Cut the leftover branches from the stump and scatter them.
* Select trees that are growing close to other trees. Cutting from dense clumps will thin areas with too many trees, thereby reducing competition and promoting growth of remaining trees.
* Cutting of trees is prohibited within all designated wildlife areas, marked timber sales, and within 300 feet of campgrounds, lodges, summer homes, private lands and administrative sites.
