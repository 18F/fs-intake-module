#### Christmas tree cutting

* The tree must be less than {{treeHeight}} feet in height if the permit was purchased online.
* You must leave a stump of {{stumpHeight}} inches in height or less. 
* No live branches should be left on the stump.
* After cutting your tree, take or scatter any unused portion of your tree.
* Select trees that are growing close to other trees. Cutting from dense clumps will thin areas with too many trees, thereby reducing competition and promoting growth of remaining trees.
* Off-road travel regulations are in effect. Information about off-road travel is available at the 
[Shoshone National Forest](https://www.fs.usda.gov/shoshone) Ranger District offices.
* Cutting of trees is prohibited within all designated wildlife areas, marked timber sales, and within 300 feet of campgrounds, lodges, summer homes, private lands and administrative sites.
