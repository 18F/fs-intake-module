* Be sure you know which tree species to avoid.
* Do not pick a tree within 100 feet of a trail, 200 feet of campgrounds or recreation sites, or within 300 feet of a stream or lake.
* Be sure another tree has space to grow within 8 feet of the one you plan to cut. Cutting trees from overcrowded areas is beneficial, as the remaining trees will grow faster.
* Avoid trees marked with blue paint or designated as a wildlife tree.
* Make sure you are on National Forest land before cutting your tree.
* Park your car in an area where it can’t be hit by a falling tree.
* Tools you will need include: a hacksaw, gloves, a tarp and rope or straps to secure your tree.
* Use an axe or handsaw to cut your tree. Motorized saws and chainsaws are prohibited.
* Remove snow from around the stump so you can accurately measure the stump and tree height.
* Cut your tree a bit longer than you'll need (6-12"), so you'll have room to make a fresh cut on the bottom before putting it in water.
* Take the whole tree. Cutting the top off a tree is prohibited.
* Have a tarp and rope ready to transport your tree once it’s cut.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall and ensure all members of your party are out of the path of the falling tree.
* Remove any boughs from the stump and scatter around a large area.
* Clean up any debris after you’re finished cutting down your tree.
* Stay out of the path of the falling tree.
