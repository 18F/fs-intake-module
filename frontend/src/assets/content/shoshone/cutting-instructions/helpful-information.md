* Select a tree growing close to other trees. Cutting from dense clumps will thin areas with too many trees, thereby reducing competition and promoting growth of the remaining trees.
* Tools you will need include a hacksaw, gloves, a tarp and rope or straps to secure your tree.
* Have a tarp and rope ready to transport your tree once itâ€™s cut.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall and ensure all members of your party (and your car) are out of the path of the tree.
* Branches must be removed from sections of trees left behind. The branches must then be scattered.
* Stay out of the path of the falling tree.
