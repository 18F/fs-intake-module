#### Helpful information

* Remove snow from around the stump so you can accurately measure the stump and tree height.
* Cut your tree a bit longer than you'll need (6-12"), so you'll have room to make a fresh cut on the bottom before putting it in water.
* Take the whole tree. Cutting the top off a tree is prohibited.
* Have a tarp and rope ready to transport your tree once it’s cut.
* Be aware of where the tree will fall and ensure all members of your party are out of the path of the falling tree.
* Remove any boughs from the stump and scatter around a large area.
* Clean up any debris after you’re finished cutting down your tree.
* Stay out of the path of the falling tree.
