    <ul>
      <li>Cut the paper with your two load tags in half to separate the tags.</li>
      <li>Fill in the day and month that you're harvesting the wood with a black marker. For example, if you harvested on the 4th of July, you would fill in "7" for the month and "4" for the day.</li>
      <li>Fold your tag on the dotted lines.</li>
      <li>Place each tag in its own zip-top bag, and close the bag.</li>
      <li>Nail your tag(s) to a piece of wood in the back of your load so that the side with the USDA logo is visible to cars behind you.</li>
