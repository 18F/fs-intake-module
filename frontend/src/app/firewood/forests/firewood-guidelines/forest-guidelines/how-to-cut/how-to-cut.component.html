<h3>Tagging your load</h3>
<p>Before hauling wood out of the forest, you will need to fill out a load tag and attach it
  to the back of your vehicle. The load tag helps law enforcement see that you have a valid
  permit and have collected your wood legally.
</p>
<p>You'll get your load tags after you purchase your permit. Each load tag is equal to 1/2 cord of wood.</p>
<h3>How many tags will you need?</h3>

  <li>Place each tag in a zip-top bag, and close the bag.</li>
  <li>Nail your tag(s) to a piece of wood in the back of your load so that it is visible to cars behind you.</li>
