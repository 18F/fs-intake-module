<!-- <h3>Tagging your load</h3>
<p>Before hauling wood out of the forest, you will need to fill out a load tag and attach it
  to the back of your vehicle. The load tag helps law enforcement see that you have a valid
  permit and have collected your wood legally.
</p>
<p>You'll get your load tags after you purchase your permit. Each load tag is equal to 1/2 cord of wood.</p>
<h3>Filling out tags for online permits</h3>

<p>To validate your tag, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fill in the day and the month that you are harvesting the wood with a black marker. For example,
    if you harvested on the 4th of July, you would fill in "4" for day and "7" for month.</li>
  <li>Fold your tag on the dotted lines</li>
  <li>Place each tag in a zip-top bag, and close the bag.</li>
  <li>Nail your tag(s) to a piece of wood in the back of your load so that it is visible to cars behind you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filling out tags for in-person permits</h3>
<p>You will be given colored load tags when you buy your permit from a district office or a registered vendor.</p>
<p>To validate your tag, you will need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Punch out the month</li>
  <li>Punch out the date</li>
  <li>Nail your tag(s) to a piece of wood in the back of your load so that it is visible to cars behind you.</li>
