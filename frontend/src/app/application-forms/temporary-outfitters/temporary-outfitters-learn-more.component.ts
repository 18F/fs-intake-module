service days varies by use area, depending on their availability and demand.
Only one temporary permit may be obtained per use area every 180 days up to
the maximum number of service days per use area (no more than 200 service
days). See the various permit pool documents for descriptions of use areas and
the max number of service days that may be applied for in each area.</p>

This means you can apply for 1 permit up to 200 days, every 6 months.</li>
          <li><strong>Example 2:</strong> Use Area "B" = 150 total pool days with a max days/permit = 50.
This means you can apply for 1 permit up to 50 days, every 6 months.</li>

        <p>Ideally, there would be plenty of days available to allow all temporary use permits
to be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. However, some permit pools are
limited and with high demand, there are simply not enough days to go around. In
this case, we will allocate the permits using a lottery based on due date. The due
dates are months ahead of the permit period to allow applicants plenty of lead
time to advertise and prepare for the trips. In the event there are unallocated
days left over after the lottery, additional permits may be issued on a first-come,
first-served basis.</p>
